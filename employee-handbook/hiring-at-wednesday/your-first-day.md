# Your first day

Congratulations! You're in the door. 

Firstly, we'd like to thank you to choose to work with Wednesday. We're a small group of people, we do make mistakes but we're always open to hear your opinion. The first day is always daunting, it's a new workplace, new people and a new culture. We'll try our best to make you feel at home.

Your first day is going to involve some amount of paperwork. Please bring the following documents with you:

* Graduation certificates
* Previous company play slips \(3 months\)
* PAN card
* Identity proof

You can even send copies of these via email to hr@wednesday.is. You will also be asked to give your bank account details.

Before you come in we always have an internal announcement so the team is expecting you. They are equally eager to meet you. We will introduce you to all the teams and their project managers. 

We'll also set you up with your desk and your shiny new macbook.
