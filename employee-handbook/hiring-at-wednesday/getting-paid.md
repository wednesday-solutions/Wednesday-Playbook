# Getting paid

All salaries are paid on the first of the month. In the occasional case where the first is a holiday it will be scheduled for the next working day

We also have another payment cycle which is on the 15th of the month. We pay all vendors and fulfil reimbursements in this cycle.

If you have incurred any expenses/want to purchase any equipment for work. Please provide the following details before the 15th of the month:

* Original bill with our company GST details \(Please get these from finances@wednesay.is\)
* An approval from your manager for the expense incurred \(Send an email to finances@wednesday.is\)

Wednesday will make the necessary TDS deductions and complete the payment on the 15th.
