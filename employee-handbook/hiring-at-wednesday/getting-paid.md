# Getting Paid

All salaries are paid on the first of the month. In the case the first is a holiday, it will be scheduled for the next working day.

Taxes are deducted on your behalf and submitted to the governments as per the income tax slab and labor laws. These deductions will be clearly mentioned in your payslip and we will issue a form 16 at the end of the financial year as proof of payment.

If you have incurred any expenses please reach out to finance@wednesday.is with the details of the expense. If your manager approves this, we will reimburse the amount with your salary.
