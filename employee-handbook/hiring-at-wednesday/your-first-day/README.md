# Your first day

Welcome and thank you for choosing to work with us.

The first day is always daunting, it's a new workplace, new people, and a new culture. We'll try our best to make you feel at home. Before you come in we do an internal announcement so the team is expecting you. We will introduce you to all the teams and their project managers. If you're joining us remotely we will ship you a new MacBook else we will have this ready for you in the office.
