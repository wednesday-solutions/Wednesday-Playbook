# Dress Code

Our mantra here is **be** **presentable**.

We don't force anyone to wear a specific attire but we expect you to use your best judgement and dress well.

We usually get invited to client offices for demos and discussions. Please follow their dress code. Most customers we work with dress formally.

We try to be as inclusive as possible so feel free to wear what makes you comfortable. But always be presentable.
