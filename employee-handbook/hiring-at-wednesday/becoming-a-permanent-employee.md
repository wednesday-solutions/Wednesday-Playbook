# Becoming a permanent employee

All full-time employees start on probation. The minimum duration is three months but can change depending on the role you are hired for. During this period the benefits & perks and some of the leaves types we offer will not apply. Please refer to the [Benefits and Perks](../benefits-and-perks/) and [Leave Policy](../how-we-work/leave-policy.md) documents to know more.

We schedule check-ins/1-1 meetings once a month to understand how things are going. We give you feedback about areas where we think you're doing well and areas where you can improve. We use these meetings as markers to understand if we're the right fit for you during your probation.

After you finish your probation and your performance is in line with our expectations you become a permanent employee. All the benefits of a permanent employee kick-in.
