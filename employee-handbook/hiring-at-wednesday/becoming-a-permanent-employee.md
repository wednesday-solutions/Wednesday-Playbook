# Becoming a permanent employee

Every employee starts on probation. We usually set a minimum period of three months but it may vary on the role.

During this period some of the perks we offer may not kick in. Please refer the [Benefits and Perks](../benefits-and-perks.md) to know more.

We schedule regular check-ins once a month to understand how things are going. We give you feedback about areas where we think you're doing really well and areas where you can improve. These are one-on-one meetings with your project manager. 

We also want to hear from you on how you think we're functioning. We believe in improving our processes. So if you think we can be more efficient let us know.

After your probation period you automatically become a permanent employee and all the benefits of a permanent employee kick-in. Congratulations!
