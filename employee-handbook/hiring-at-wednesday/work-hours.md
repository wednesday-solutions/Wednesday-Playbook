# Work Hours

We believe a flexible schedule allows you to complete your duties outside of work. However, with great power comes great responsibility.

In general our day starts between 10-10:30 in the morning. Each team has their own fixed time. It's very important to reach work at this time as we have daily standups that we expect you to be a part of.

If you have any important work that needs to be done please schedule it after your standup. Please ensure your work time always overlaps with the rest of the team. We expect you to have a minimum of 5 hours of overlap with your team.

If you need to leave for some work please keep your project manager informed.

We also believe in taking frequent breaks \(a trip with a loved out, a good book can freshen you up\). Work life balance is overrated. Deadlines are a reality and sometimes you may be required to work extra hours. However, we do not encourage working late for a long period of time \(we've seen enough friends burn out\).
