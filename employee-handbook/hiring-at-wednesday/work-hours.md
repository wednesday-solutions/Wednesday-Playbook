# Work Hours

We believe a flexible schedule allows you to complete your duties outside of work. Our day starts between 10-10:30 in the morning. It's very important to start work at this time so that you're a part of the standups.

If you have any important work that needs to be done please schedule it after your standup and keep your manager informed. Please ensure your work time overlaps with the rest of the team. We expect a minimum of 6 hours of overlap.

Deadlines are a reality and sometimes you may be required to work extra hours. However, we do not encourage working late for a long period of time (we've seen enough friends burn out) instead we encourage frequent breaks.
