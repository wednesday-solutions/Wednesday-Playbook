# Leave Policy

Here are a [list of holidays](holiday-list.md) we follow.

We encourage you to take time off work. Let's face it deadlines are a reality and sometimes you will need to work extra hours. Talk to your manager and schedule some time off. 

We use an online tool called timetastic. Please use this to request time off. Also, always communicate this with your entire team and ensure your time off is marked on the OOO calendar.
