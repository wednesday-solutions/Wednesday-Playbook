# Performance Appraisal Policy

Performance appraisals are done annually at Wednesday in two cycles i.e., April & October depending on eligibility.

Performance reviews, however, are continuous and include feedback from team members, managers, peers, and colleagues.&#x20;

### Eligibility Criteria & Frequency

Eligibility for the performance review is determined based on the following criteria:

* All team members who have completed one year at Wednesday as of April 1st or October 1st will be eligible for the performance appraisal for April or October, respectively.
* All team members who have completed one year from their last appraisal on April 1st or October 1st will be eligible for the performance appraisal for April or October cycle, respectively.

> Please Note: If a team member does not meet the eligibility criteria for the current review cycle, they will be considered for the next available review cycle if eligible.

#### For Example

Suppose a team member joined the organization in August 2023. So they would complete one year in August 2024 and be eligible for the October 2024 cycle.
