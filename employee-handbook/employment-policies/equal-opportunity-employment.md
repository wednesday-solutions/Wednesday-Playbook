# Equal Opportunity Employment

Wednesday is an Equal Opportunity Employer. The company supports diversity and inclusion and does not discriminate against qualified employees or applicants based on race, color, religion, gender identity, sex, sexual preference, sexual identity, pregnancy, ancestry, citizenship, age, marital status, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, military status, or any other characteristic protected by Indian national or state law or local ordinance. This Policy is meant to provide a safe, diverse, and comfortable workplace at Wednesday. This Policy is not legally mandated and, therefore, is not judicially enforceable in India. This Policy is without prejudice to any anti-discrimination provisions of applicable law including, but not restricted to, the provisions of:

* Article 17 of the Constitution of India;
* the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955,
* the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989;
* the Sexual Harassment of Women at the Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013;
* Sections 354 and 509 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860; and,
* the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995.

This policy governs all aspects of employment including, selection, job assignment, compensation, discipline, termination, and access to benefits and training.

Wednesday will not adversely discriminate, and prohibits other adverse discrimination at the workplace, on the basis of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, descent, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, age, or any of them ("Discrimination Characteristics"). Wednesday will not condone any adverse discrimination against any person on its premises, whether that person is in its employment or otherwise.

Any person who believes herself to have been subjected to adverse discrimination on the basis of the Discrimination Characteristics is encouraged to bring the matter to the attention of the management at Wednesday at the earliest practical opportunity. No person will be punished, retaliated against, or limited in employment or other opportunity for exercising anything set out in this Policy, or for filing a complaint, furnishing information for, or participating in an investigation, or any other activity related to the administration of this Policy. Any adverse discrimination or other action or behaviour that constitutes an offense will be reported to the police.

Wednesday provides equal opportunities to its employment, consultancy, or otherwise without regard for the Discrimination Characteristics. All actions of Wednesday with regard to its employees, consultants, advisors, interns, and staff, including but not limited to those relating to compensation, benefits, transfers, leave, layoffs, training, education, and assistance, will be made without regard for the Discrimination Characteristics.

When necessary, the company will reasonably accommodate employees and applicants with disabilities if the person is otherwise qualified to safely perform all of the essential functions of the position.
