# Performance Appraisal Policy

### **Frequency & Timing**

Performance appraisals will occur **once per year**, taking place each **February**, and will become effective from **April 1** of the same year.

### **Eligibility**

* Employees who have completed at least **10 months of continuous service** by February of the appraisal year will be eligible to participate in that cycle.
* Increments and adjustments for employees with less than a year of service may be determined on a **prorated basis**, at the company’s discretion.
* To be eligible for appraisal, employees are expected to:
  * Successfully complete their **probation period** within the same year. Written confirmation of completion should be recorded with HR, and employees are encouraged to ensure this is received.
  * Set their **OKRs** for the review period.
  * Hold regular **OKR review meetings** (recommended at least once every two months) and maintain notes of these discussions.

### **Employee Ownership**

* Employees are responsible for driving their own performance conversations by setting OKRs, scheduling reviews, and maintaining records.
* The company encourages frequent reviews, as they create more opportunities for feedback, alignment, and growth.
