# Employee Privacy

## Personnel Records

Wednesday maintains a personnel file for each employee. The personnel file includes information such as an employee’s job application, resume, record of training, documentation of performance appraisal, salary/fee increases, and other employment/contract records. Records and information regarding each employee is maintained to support benefit programs and employment actions. Therefore, employees are asked to notify an Administrator of any changes in:

* Name
* Bank Account details
* Address and/or telephone number
* Number of dependents
* Emergency contact person
* Qualifications
* Change in Resident Status

### Access to Files

Personnel files are the property of Wednesday and access to the information they contain is restricted. Generally, only the HR team and the Management will have access to these files.

## Email Privacy

Wednesday's email is not being actively monitored by anyone, but because it is a company resource that is managed according to company policy, you should not expect privacy. The company has both the ability and the right to look at employee usage to protect both employee safety and well being, as well as company property and interests.

Email messages, including attachments, sent and received from a Wednesday email address are the property of Wednesday. We reserve the right to access, monitor, read, and/or copy email messages at any time, for any reason. You should not expect privacy for any email you send using your Wednesday email, including messages that you consider to be personal or label with a designation such as “Personal” or “Private.”

### Use of the Email System for Personal Email

The email system is intended for official Company business. If you send personal messages through the Company’s email system, you must exercise discretion as to the number and type of messages you send. You must also ensure that your personal use of the email system does not interfere in any way with your job duties or performance.

### All Conduct Rules Apply to Email

All of our policies and rules of conduct apply to employee use of the email system. This means, for example, that you may not use the email system to send harassing or discriminatory messages, including messages with explicit sexual content or pornographic images; to send threatening messages, or to reveal company confidential information.

### Professional Tone and Content

We expect you to exercise discretion in your electronic communications. When you send an email using a Wednesday email address or Wednesday social account, you are representing Wednesday. Make sure that your messages are professional and appropriate, in tone and content. Remember, although email or social media may seem like a private conversation, they can be printed, saved, and forwarded to unintended recipients. You should not send any email/message/update/etc. that you wouldn’t want our team, your family, or our competitors to read.

### Email Security

To avoid email viruses, phishing for account information, and other threats, employees should not open email attachments from people and businesses they don’t recognize, particularly if the email appears to have been forwarded multiple times or has a nonexistent or peculiar subject heading. Even if you know the sender, do not open an email attachment that has a strange name or is not referenced in the body of the email; it may have been transmitted automatically, without the sender’s knowledge.

If you believe your computer has been infected by a virus, worm, or other security threat to Wednesday’s system, you must inform the Chief Security Office (currently Ali) immediately.

Employees may not share their email passwords with anyone, including coworkers or family members.

## Privacy when using Wednesday's Communication Tools

Some Wednesday employees have administrative access to some or all of Wednesday's communication and collaboration tools, including Wednesday-managed Google apps and accounts, Slack, and JIRA. We reserve the right to monitor employee use of the Wednesday's communication tools at any time. You should not expect that your use of these communication tools, including but not limited to the sites you visit and the communications you have, will be private.
