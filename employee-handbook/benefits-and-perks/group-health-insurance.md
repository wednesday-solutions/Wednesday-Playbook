# Group Health Insurance

Our group health insurance covers hospital expenses for injuries and diseases.&#x20;

We provide a family floater of **Rs. 3,00,000** per team member. You can add up to two dependants on your policy. Under this, you or any added dependant's expenses up to Rs 3,00,000 per year will be covered.

All full-time employees who are not covered under the government prescribed scheme (ESIC) will be covered under the group health insurance.&#x20;
