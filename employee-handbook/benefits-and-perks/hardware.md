# Hardware & Software Licenses

We invest heavily in hardware and software licenses that allow you to do great work. This allows you to focus on your work and build on top of what is available.

## Hardware

The hardware we provide is divided into two types:

1. Shared Resources
2. Dedicated Resources

### Shared Resources

Shared resources are available in the office for everyone to use. Here is a list of resources we have:

| Device | No. Of Devices |
| :--- | :--- |
| Android Tablet | 2 |
| iPad | 1 |
| iPhone | 3 |
| Wireless mouse | 8 |
| Wireless keyboard | 4 |
| iPhone Charging Cables | 10 |
| Monitors | 10 |

These resources are only available to employees \(probation, permanent, and interns\) working from our office. If you wish to take any of them home \(barring the monitors\) please let the admin know.

### Dedicated Resources

These resources are not shared and are only used by you. They are provided to every employee \(probation and permanent\) except interns. We provide 13 inch MacBook pros for use. Depending on the project you are working on we will provide additional resources including phones and tablets. Please talk to your manager and see if this applies to your project.

## Software Licenses

We currently have paid licenses for the following

* Github
* Webflow
* JIRA
* Zeplin
* Sketch
* Adobe
* Freepik
* Craftwork
* JetBrains

If you need any of them for your work please get in touch with Mac and he will hook you up with a license.

## Responsibility

At the moment none of our devices are under insurance \(we are working on it\). Please use them with care. The cost of repair for each of these devices may be high and in case there is damage will have to be borne by you.
