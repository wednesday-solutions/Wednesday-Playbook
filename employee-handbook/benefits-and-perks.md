# Benefits and Perks

## Conferences and Speaking Engagements

We encourage everyone to attend conferences. It's a place to get to know what fellow colleagues are working on, talk about your work, the processes you follow and to see if we learn something that helps us improve as a team.

If you wish to attend any conference please let your project manager know. In most cases if it applies to your work we will sponsor your conference pass. Incase, it doesn't we will allow a paid leave to ensure you get to attend the event.

Incase of a speaking engagement we will provide the following perks:

* An amount of 75$ or ₹1,200 per day as allowance \(depending on where the conference is\).
* We do not sponsor conferences that are more than 5 days long. The daily allowance will be capped at a max of 5 days.
* Incase the conference you have decided to speak at does not sponsor your stay, visa and travel expenses we will provide a max 500$ or ₹5,000 travel and accommodation allowance. This will be payable on receipt of all travel invoices and will be scheduled on the 15th of the next month.
