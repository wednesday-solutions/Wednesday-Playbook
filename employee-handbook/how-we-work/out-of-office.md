# Out of Office

We understand the importance of taking time off to recharge and refresh. However, while you are away, your absence could potentially impact the work and projects of your clients and colleagues.&#x20;

Follow these guidelines if you're out of the office:

1. **Plan:** Document what you're working on, and do an internal handover. Introduce your client to your teammate. Ensure there is overlap.
2. **Inform:** Let your team and client know the dates that you will be unavailable.
3. **Email responder:** Please setup an OOO email responder. The email should include the date that you're unavailable. It should also give details of the person to get in touch with in your absence.
