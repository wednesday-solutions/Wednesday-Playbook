# Our Leave Policy

Here is the [list of holidays](../benefits-and-perks/holiday-list.md) we follow and the [paid time off](../benefits-and-perks/paid-time-off.md).

We encourage you to take time off work. Let's face it: deadlines are a reality, and sometimes you will need to work extra hours. Talk to your manager and schedule some time off if you need it.&#x20;

## Leave cycle

The calendar year, i.e., starting 1st Jan to 31st December is what we use to track a leave cycle.

## Guidelines on how to apply for leaves

Making sure your leave requests are smooth and efficient:

1. Submit your requests through the HRMS.
2. Let your manager/team know. This will allow them to support you during your absence, ensuring a smoother workflow for everyone. Aim to inform them 1-2 weeks before your planned leave.
3. Remember to drop an email to [hr@wednesday.is](mailto:hr@wednesday.is) for your leave request.

## Miscellaneous&#x20;

* If any employee is out of leaves it will be considered unpaid.
* When working from home if deliverables are not met the manager can mark you for half the day. This will however be communicated with you.
* Any planned leave will not be permitted during the notice period or during probation.
* Unused leaves (apart from annual leave) will not be encashed or forwarded to the next cycle.

_Note: The above policies are only applicable to full-time employees. Interns are allowed sick leaves only._
