# Our Leave Policy

Here is the [list of holidays](../benefits-and-perks/holiday-list.md) we follow and the [paid time off](../benefits-and-perks/paid-time-off.md).

We encourage you to take time off work. Let's face it: deadlines are a reality, and sometimes you will need to work extra hours. Talk to your manager and schedule some time off if you need it.&#x20;

***

## Leave cycle

The calendar year, i.e., starting 1st January to 31st December is what we use to track a leave cycle.

***

## **Leave Entitlement**

### Sick/ Casual Leave (SL/CL)

1. You can avail of eight days of SL/CLs per year.
2. Every quarter, you will be granted 2 SL/CLs.
3. During your first 90 days (probation), we prioritize your well-being. If you need time off due to illness, paid sick leave is available.
4. These SL/CL cannot be carried forward to the next year, if unused, the leaves will lapse.&#x20;

### Annual Leave (AL)

1. You will be credited 4 additional leaves at the beginning of the year 2025, representing the balance of the annual earned leave entitlement for 2024.
2. For new joiners, once you hit your 90-day mark during your probation, you'll be eligible to take some well-deserved time off with annual leaves (on a pro-rata basis).
3. Unused leave balances from each quarter carry over to the next, so you can plan your time off flexibly.
4. You can carry forward your unused leave days for next year up to a maximum of 45 days.

#### Note

* **Encashment:**
  * If you apply for annual leave at least 15 days in advance, and Wednesday refuses to approve it, you can encash any leave beyond 45 days.
  * Example: If an employee has 50 days of AL, they can encash 5 days if the leaves are refused.
  * You are eligible to encash AL beyond 45 days at the time of separation.
* **Usage:**
  * Leaves must be planned and applied for with at least 7-15 daysâ€™ notice for approval.

### Maternity Leave

As per the Maternity Benefit Act, eligible moms get paid leave and job protection (up to 26 weeks).

#### Note

1. _You're eligible if you have worked for at least 80 days in the 12 months preceding your expected delivery date._
2. _You can avail 26 weeks of paid leave for the first two children and 12 weeks for subsequent children._
3. _You can take up to 8 weeks of this leave before your due date, allowing flexibility to prepare for childbirth._
4. _You're also eligible for 6 weeks of leave in case of miscarriage or medical termination of pregnancy._
5. _During the maternity leave, working for any other employer will terminate your employment with Wednesday._
6. _Upon availing of this leave, you will be exempted from the regular performance cycle._
7. _Try and give your team as much advance notice as possible._

### Complimentary Off (Comp Off)

Team members may request Comp Off for working on weekends.

1. Please note that approval from both the reporting manager and delivery head is required.
2. Additionally, kindly ensure that the client is informed regarding the same.

## Guidelines on how to apply for leaves

Making sure your leave requests are smooth and efficient:

1. Submit your requests through the HRMS.
2. Let your manager/team know. This will allow them to support you during your absence, ensuring a smoother workflow for everyone. Aim to inform them 1-2 weeks before your planned leave.
3. Remember to drop an email to [hr@wednesday.is](mailto:hr@wednesday.is) for your leave request.
4. Absence without prior notice or approval will be treated as unapproved absence and may result in loss of pay or disciplinary action.

## Miscellaneous&#x20;

1. If any employee is out of leaves it will be considered unpaid.
2. When working from home if deliverables are not met the manager can mark you for half the day. This will however be communicated with you.
3. Any planned leave will not be permitted during the notice period or during probation.
4. For employees joining mid-year, leave entitlement will be calculated from the date of joining.
5. This policy is subject to periodic review and may be amended in line with changes to applicable laws or company requirements.

#### Note

The above policies are only applicable to full-time employees. Interns are allowed sick leaves only.&#x20;
