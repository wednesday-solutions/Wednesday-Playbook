# Leave Policy

Here is the [list of holidays](../benefits-and-perks/holiday-list.md) we follow.

We encourage you to take time off work. Let's face it deadlines are a reality and sometimes you will need to work extra hours. Talk to your manager and schedule some time off.&#x20;

## Leave cycle

The calendar year i.e. starting 1st Jan to 31st December is what we use to track a leave cycle.

## Guidelines on how to apply for leaves

We use a tool called Kredily to automate the leave management process. Please login to your account and apply for a leave.

* If it's a planned leave inform your team and manager on slack.
* If you're applying for a sick leave drop a message on slack or WhatsApp and let your manager know.
