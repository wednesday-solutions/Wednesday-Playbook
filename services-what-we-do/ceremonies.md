And [here's a link](https://playbook.wednesday.is/services-what-we-do/amplify-scaleups-and-hyper-growth-companies#product-led-growth-1) to a set of ceremonies that encourage Product Led Growth

Conduct the the following to encourage sharing, & smoother delivery

**User Testing**_**:**_ Arrange user testing sessions where we get a group of people from the company to use the product that you’ve created. To start off with this can be folks from the HR, marketing, sales and engineering (other than the engineers on your team) department.

* _Objective:_ We need to fix an objective for the session before it is conducted.
* _Pre-framing & Preparation:_ We must pre-frame the session with information so people know what to expect. Share details in the calendar invite, slack messages, send installation instructions, etc.
* _During the session_: The project owner/lead should have a clear set of questions that they want to get answers to. Also, be prepared to answer your team's questions about the product for you.
* _Post the session_: Create a report showing what was observed or learnt and the steps taken. This way we can measure if those objectives were met the next time.
* _Frequency_: A cadence of 30 minutes per week.

**Usability Testing:** Arrange usability testing sessions where each workflow, error message, muscle memory, etc., is tested across users to ensure what we’re building is usable, intuitive and a good citizen in the ecosystem. We should measure the likelihood of performing intended actions and send out surveys with detailed descriptions of attendees' experiences.

**Cross-Functional Workshops:** These sessions are geared towards cross-functional sharing across the delivery team - the PMs, engineers, support personnel, testers & designers dissect the good, bad and ugly parts of the product and share their candid views and what should be better, things that should be included in the roadmap, and items that we should remove and no longer maintain.

**Brown bag lunches**_:_ These are informal sharing sessions that need to be facilitated by Managers/Leads for intra-team sharing sessions. Use this to remove blind spots and democratise information about the project. Use it to share product and tech innovation opportunities. This isn’t a world is my oyster situation - it’s a bounded session where what we’re discussing affects and is part of the project that we’re on in some way or form.
