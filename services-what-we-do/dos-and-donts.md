# Do's and don'ts

Hey Team,

I wanted to have a quick heart-to-heart about how we can all do our best work while keeping things cool and supportive around here. It's like setting up some simple ground rules, but in a way that feels more like guidelines from a friend than orders from above.

#### Here's the Deal:

1. **Let's Get Clear First**: Before jumping into anything, let's ensure we all know what we're doing and why. It's like making sure we're all rowing in the same direction.
2. **Share the Cool Stuff**: Found a neat trick or learned something new? Don't keep it to yourself. Sharing is caring, right?
3. **Think Like Our Users**: We're making stuff for real people, so let's keep them in mind. Would they find it easy and useful? That's our goal.
4. **Talk It Out**: Got a question or a different take on something? Let's hear it. It's all about teaming up to make things better.
5. **Care About What We're Building**: Let's all throw in our two cents when we're planning stuff. If something doesn't make sense, ask about it. We're all in this together.
6. **Small Steps**: Try to do a bit every day that helps us move forward. Keeps things manageable and less overwhelming.
7. **Test, Test, Test**: No code leaves the door without a test. It's like double-checking your work before turning it in.
8. **Keep Things Smooth**: Let's not mess up what's working. If we're adding something new, let's make sure it fits without a hitch.
9. **Make It Easy and Fun**: We want everyone to enjoy using what we build. So, let's make it work well and feel good to use.
10. **Mistakes? They Happen**: We're trying stuff out, right? If something doesn't go as planned, no sweat. We learn, we fix, we move on.

#### And a Couple of Don'ts:

1. **Fear Not**: Scared of messing up? Don't be. It's how we learn. Just don't make a habit of it.
2. **Try Before You Ask**: Stuck on something? Give it a solid try first. Then, let's rally the troops if needed.
3. **All Work and No Play**: Pulling too many late nights? Let's flag it. We do our best work when we're feeling our best.
4. **Stay Silent**: Got updates or hit a snag? Keep us in the loop. No surprises, please.
5. **Go It Alone**: Remember, we're a team. So, let's keep the lines open, share the load, and cheer each other on.

That's pretty much it. Simple, right? Just a few things to keep in mind as we do what we do best. Here's to making great stuff together and having a good time doing it.

I'll see you on Slack,\
Mac.
