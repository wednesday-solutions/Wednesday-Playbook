# Catalyse - For companies looking for staff augmentation services

Oftentimes, in a product development journey, there are moments when the processes, framework and system are already in place, and we need additional hands on deck to make it happen. And like the age-old saying - the magic is in doing.

Through Catalyse, we supplement a product development teamâ€™s velocity by embedding into their team structure. This helps clear up any implementation bottlenecks.&#x20;
