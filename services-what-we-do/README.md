# Services - What we do

Through experience and failure, by observing and driving growth for various products, weâ€™ve created battle-tested frameworks and processes tailored to different stages of product development. These theoretical models and real-world solutions are forged together, forming the base of our four core service lines.&#x20;

While following these practices is important, it is equally important, if not more, to question the purpose of each activity and understand how it ties into the larger goal.&#x20;

In a nutshell

_**Launch**:_  Work with the customer to hit PMF

_**Amplify**_: Work with a post-PMF customer (could be a previous Launch customer) and help them scale sustainably and profitably.

_**Catalyse**_: Work with conventions laid down by the customer to increase product development velocity.

_**Control**_: Work with enterprises on fast-paced tight-deadline projects with moonshot ROI.
