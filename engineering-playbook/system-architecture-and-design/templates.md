  A quick look at what constitutes a Template in Wednesday's workflow. How we

# Templates

Wednesday has expertise in certain frameworks and technologies. We actively maintain repositories that showcase how we build applications with those frameworks. These repositories are what we call "Templates".&#x20;

We ask all new joiners to read these templates and understand how we write tests, automate builds, and review code.
