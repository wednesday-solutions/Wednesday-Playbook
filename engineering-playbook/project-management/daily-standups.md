# Standups

Standups are daily 15 minute meetings and are held at the start of the day.

â€ŒHere is how it goes:

1. **Step 1**: Sync up. What you've worked on yesterday, what you're planning to work on today, and do you have any blockers. Cover these subjects. Keep it short, no nitty-gritty.
2. **Step 2**: Questions and block time for further discussion.
3. Start your day.
