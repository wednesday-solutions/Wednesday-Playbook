# Hiring Engineers

## Hiring Process

### 1. Evaluate the job for suitability

Please go through the job description and the roles and responsibilities. This will help avoid any last-minute surprises.

### 2. Technical Interview (s)

Upon receipt of your application, we will schedule technical interviews.

**What to expect**

* We conduct this interview online. Expect to share your screen and build an application with us.
* Expect questions on code architecture, tests, performance, and understanding the fundamentals of the framework.

**What we are looking for**

* Ability to build applications that work deterministically.
* Code quality - should be readable and maintainable.
* Understanding of architecture principles.
* Ability to take feedback and incorporate change.

## **Miscellaneous**

* After each step in the interview process, we will let you know the outcome within 2-3 working days.
* **Motivation**: All the work we do at Wednesday requires you to perform permutations and come up with a novel solution. There is no algorithm to do what we do. Given this what we look for are examples of what you have built on your own. Have you learned a new programming language? Have you built/contributed to an open-source project? If you've been doing it so far you'll continue to do it ahead.
* We do not ask you to answer questions about algorithms you've learned in college. What we focus on is hands-on expertise with the frameworks you know.
