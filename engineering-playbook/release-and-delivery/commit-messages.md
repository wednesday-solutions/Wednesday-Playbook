# Commit Messages

Git commit messages are a way to communicate change to fellow developers. To communicate change understanding context and why that change is necessary is important. We want all our repositories to have a commit log that is easy to consume and understand.

Please take a look at these seven rules for great git commit messages:

* [Separate subject from body with a blank line](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#separate)
* [Limit the subject line to 50 characters](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#limit-50)
* [Capitalize the subject line](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#capitalize)
* [Do not end the subject line with a period](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#end)
* [Use the impreative mood in the subject line](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#imperative)
* [Wrap the body at 72 characters](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#wrap-72)
* [Use the body to explain what and why vs. how](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#why-not-how)

Before starting a new project discuss with the team and agree to a consistent commit message strategy.
