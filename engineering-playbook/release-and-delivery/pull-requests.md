# Pull requests

Tips to help create better PRs:

* **Name**: Give your feature branch a clear name.
* **Ticket**: Add a link to the ticket on JIRA.
* **Description**: Add a brief description describing the changes you have made.
* **Screenshot/Gif**: Add a screenshot/gif (use a tool called LICEcap) that shows the feature in action.
* **Health checks**: Ensure all lint, build, and test phases complete without failures.&#x20;
* **Assignee**: Assign a person to review your PR.&#x20;
