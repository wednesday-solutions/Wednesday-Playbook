# Introduction

This handbook is meant for engineers. It explains our approach to software development.

There are many things that can go wrong with product development. In most cases \(if the team is competent\) the reasons aren't technical. Projects fail because of the soft side of software development. This includes - communication, code reviews, style guides, continuous integration, tests, etc.

This handbook brings all the engineers working with Wednesday on the same page.
