# Our Values As Designers

* _Listen_: We cannot design for our customers and their users if we don’t start here.
* _Learn & Share_: We encourage independent learning. Each one learns a separate skill. We share our learnings so as a group we cover more ground.
* _Iterative Design_: We can’t get everything right the first time. On a high level, we understand who we’re solving for, and what problem we’re solving. We then keep iterating to optimize business metrics.
* _Mentorship_: Growth only comes when you step outside your comfort zone. We put together a custom-tailored program for each member of the team. This program is tailored for you to achieve your goals in line with ours.
