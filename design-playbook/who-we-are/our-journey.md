# Our Journey

Wednesday started with two engineers who wanted to build digital products that have an impact. Early on we realized it was impossible to build for the next billion without product design. Experience and interface are crucial for user adoption.

Over the years our team has grown. Weâ€™ve added skills to our repertoire and are learning and growing every day.
