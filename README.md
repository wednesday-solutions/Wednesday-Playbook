# Wednesday Playbook

At Wednesday we're working hard to build an environment that is inclusive, open and appreciative. We've found that having a value driven company is has helped us hire some of the best people who not only build amazing software but are also really nice to work with.

As we expand our team we were looking for a starter-kit that explains all the policies we follow at Wednesday. 

This book contains everything you need to know about the policies we follow, the way we work, hire and deliver amazing experiences to our customer.

If these policies sound like a place where you want to work reach out to us at hello@wednesday.is
