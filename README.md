# Wednesday Playbook

At Wednesday we're working hard to build an environment that is inclusive, open and appreciative. We've found that building a value driven company is has helped us hire some of the best people who not only build amazing software but are also really nice to work with.

As we expand our team we were looking for a starter-kit that explains how we work and the policies we follow.

This book contains everything you need to know about the way we work, the practices we follow, how we hire and deliver amazing experiences to our customers.

After reading this if you feel like this is a place where you will fit send us an email at hello@wednesday.is.

CEO - Wednesday
