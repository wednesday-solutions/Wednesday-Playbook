# Becoming a permanent employee

Everyone starts on probation. We set a small period of three months but it may vary on the role. During this period the perks and some of the leaves we offer will not apply. Please refer to the [Benefits and Perks](../benefits-and-perks/) document to know more.

We schedule check-ins/1-1 meetings once a month to understand how things are going. We give you feedback about areas where we think you're doing well and areas where you can improve. We also want to hear from you on how you think we're functioning. We believe in improving our processes. So if you think we can be more efficient let us know.

After you finish your probation period and your performance is in line with our expectations you become a permanent employee. All the benefits of a permanent employee kick-in.
