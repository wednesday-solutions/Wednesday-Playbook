# Getting Paid

All salaries are paid on the first of the month. In the case where the first is a holiday, it will be scheduled for the next working day

Taxes are deducted on your behalf and submitted to the governments as per the income tax slab and labour laws. These deductions will be clearly mentioned in your payslip and we will issue a form 16 at the end of the financial year as proof of payment.

If you have incurred any expenses please reach out to finance@wednesday.is with the details of the expense. If this is approved by your manager we will reimburse this amount along with your salary.
