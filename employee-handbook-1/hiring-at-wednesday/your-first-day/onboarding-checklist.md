# Onboarding Checklist

We're going to divide this into two parts:

1. Pre-joining Checklist
2. First-day Checklist

## Pre-joining Checklist

* **Employee Documents**: Please request all documents mentioned in the [Annexure 1](../../../legal-templates/legal/offer-letter-1/annexure-1.md) of our [Offer Letter](../../../legal-templates/legal/offer-letter-1/) to be sent to hr@wednesday.is.
* **Hardware**: Please raise a purchase order to our hardware vendor to arrange the necessary equipment before the joining date. Account for a buffer if the equipment needs to be shipped.
* **Accommodation**: In case the candidate is moving to Pune please introduce them to a few brokers we have worked with.
* **Account setup**: We use many SAAS tools and depending on the role, access will need to be granted. Talk to the lead and ensure their accounts are created before joining day. Some common ones include:
  * Email
  * Slack
  * Kredily

## First-day Checklist

We'll divide this checklist into two types:

1. Candidate joining remotely
2. Candidate joining us in the office

#### Candidate joining remotely

* **Introductions**: Make an announcement on our Slack channel and introduce them to the team.
* **Schedule a meeting**: Get on a zoom/hangout and explain the different policies we follow. This should be a short call \(max 30 mins\)

#### Candidate joining us in the office

* **Tour**: Please give the candidate a tour of our office. Show them their desk.
* **Introductions**: Make an announcement on our Slack channel and introduce them in person to their team.
