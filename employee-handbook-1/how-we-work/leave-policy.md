# Leave Policy

Here is the [list of holidays](../benefits-and-perks/holiday-list.md) we follow.

We encourage you to take time off work. Let's face it deadlines are a reality and sometimes you will need to work extra hours. Talk to your manager and schedule some time off. 

## Leave cycle

The financial year i.e. starting 1st April to 31st March is what we use to track a leave cycle.

## Guidelines on how to apply for leaves

We use a tool called Kredily to automate the leave management process. Please login to your account and apply for a leave.

* If it's a planned leave inform your team and manager on slack.
* If you're applying for a sick leave drop a message on slack or WhatsApp and let your manager know.

## Miscellaneous 

* If any employee is out of leaves it will be considered unpaid.
* When working from home if deliverables are not met the manager can mark you for half the day. This will however be communicated with you.
* Any planned leave will not be permitted during the notice period or during probation.
* Unused leaves will not be encashed or forwarded to the next cycle.

Note: The above policies are only applicable to full-time employees. Interns are allowed sick leaves only.
