# Introduction

Welcome to Wednesday and thank you for choosing to work here. This handbook explains the employment policies & practices we follow and the day to day tools we use. These have come about after experimenting with different practices, inviting suggestions, and positive conversation. Given that Wednesday is a growing company we will continue to update this book.

It is each employee's responsibility to read this playbook and familiarize themselves with how we would like to operate and conduct business.

We also invite your suggestions and feedback.
