# Dream Team

We think a small group of skilled people who have our [values](our-values.md) is a force to reckon with. Over the years we’ve built such a team and are always looking for like-minded people.

We don’t believe in hiring in numbers or hiring for the years of experience someone has. That has never worked for us. We believe in hiring for character and skill-set. A group of people who don't have the "This is not a part of my job" attitude leads to an environment where one is naturally learnings. This is our dream team.
