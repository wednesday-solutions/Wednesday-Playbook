# Compensation

### Salary

When used as a motivational tool, though, it can incentivize the wrong kind of optimizations. Our goal with salary is that it checks the box of "enough" for folks who are excited about working at Wednesday and then fades into the background.

* **Fair and Equitable**: A basic tenet of our framework is that everyone doing the same work gets paid the same
* **Simple and** **Accessible**: Our formula needs to be simple enough for everyone to understand
* **Adaptable:** Our framework needs to be able to adapt and evolve
* **Competitive:** Our compensation package remains competitive

Wednesday evaluates compensation annually. Our ability to offer raises is dependent on our current financial situation.

### Retention Bonus

Wednesday only offers retention bonus on completion on a year. The details of this bonus \(if applicable\) will be clearly mentioned in your offer.
