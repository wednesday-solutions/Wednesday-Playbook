# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct applies to all Wednesday team members in all Wednesday communities online \(including but not limited to Wednesday's internal and external Slack groups, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram\), while working in the Wednesday office or remotely, at all events hosted by Wednesday, at industry events attended by a Wednesday employee, whether or not directly representing Wednesday.

## Inclusion and Harassment

Wednesday is dedicated to creating an inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, color, sex \(with or without sexual conduct and including pregnancy and sexual orientation involving transgender status/gender identity, and sex-stereotyping\), national origin, age, disability \(physical or mental\), genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, marital status, and political affiliation as well as gender expression, medical condition, mental illness, socioeconomic status or background, neuro\(a\)typicality, physical appearance, body size, computing experience, or clothing.

We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to the protected classes above, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Harassment does not need to be recognized as unwanted or unwelcome by anyone other than the person being harassed.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Offensive jokes are not appropriate and will not be tolerated under any circumstance. Consider that calling attention to differences can feel alienating.

### Ethical Standards

In order to avoid _\(even the appearance of a conflict of interest\)_, employees/consultants are expected to abide by the following code of ethical conduct.

* Employees/Consultants of the Company should not solicit anything of value from any person or organization with which the Company has a current or potential business relationship.
* Employees/Consultants of the Company should not accept any item of value from any party in exchange for or in connection with a business transaction between the Company and that other party.
* Employees/Consultants may accept items of incidental value from customers, suppliers or others as long as the gift is not given in response to solicitation on her part and as long as it implies no exchange for business purposes. Items may include gifts, gratuities, food, drink, and entertainment. Any item mentioned above which is more than Rs. 2,500 should be declared to the respective Program Officer/Manager and the Administrator.
* If an employee is faced with and is unsure how to handle a situation that she believes, has the potential to violate this code of ethical conduct, she should notify her Program Officer/Manager or the Administrator.
* Disregarding or failing to comply with this standard of business ethics and conduct could lead to disciplinary action, up to and including possible termination of employment.
* Employees and Consultants may not participate in activities that conflict with or appear to conflict with the business interests of Wednesday and/or our clients’ or that hurt the employee’s job performance. This policy establishes only the framework within which Wednesday wishes business to operate. No “presumption of guilt” is created by the mere existence of a relationship with outside firms. However, if employees have any influence or transactions involving purchases, contracts, or leases, it is imperative that they disclose to the Company as soon as possible the existence of any actual or potential conflict of interest so that safeguards can be established to protect all parties.

### Dress Code

All employees are expected to use good judgment in dressing in order to present a neat, well- groomed appearance while conducting business, in or outside of the office.

### Use of Office Assets

Employees are responsible for using the Internet in a manner that is ethical and lawful. Use of the Internet must solely be for business purposes and must not interfere with employee productivity.

### Confidential Information

While working with Wednesday, the employee/consultant agrees that she will not disclose or use any of Wednesday's confidential information, either during or after her employment.

Employees/Consultants should not leave any sensitive information lying about or unguarded. All questions regarding and requests for confidential information, including reference requests, should be referred to immediate management.

### Housekeeping and Workplace Hygiene

Wednesday would like to maintain the highest standards of hygiene and cleanliness in its premises. This is not possible without the active involvement and cooperation of all the employees. All Company property must be handled with care. Work areas should be kept clean and tidy. Tools, equipment, and materials must be kept in their proper places. Employees’ cooperation is sought in the proper disposal of wastes, garbage, and trash and also in maintaining hygiene in the toilets. 

## Complaint Policy

Wednesday has a virtual open-door policy, so employees are encouraged to report work-related concerns. If something about your job is bothering you, or if you have a question, concern, idea, or problem related to your work, please discuss it with Ali as soon as possible.
