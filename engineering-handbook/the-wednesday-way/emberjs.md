# Emberjs Styleguide

We love Ember. It is one of the most opinionated frameworks we have used.

### Project Structure

This is one of the most fundamental questions on any project. How are the files laid out? The ember framework supports two types of structures:

* Classic structure: Modules are organised at the top by type i.e. controllers, templates, routes etc.
* Pod structure: Here modules are organised by namespace, then name and then type.

We prefer to use the pod structure. A large part of this decision is because it makes things very easy to read.

_Note: With the module unification_ [_RFC_](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/143) _being merged it seems the larger audience prefers the pods approach as well._
