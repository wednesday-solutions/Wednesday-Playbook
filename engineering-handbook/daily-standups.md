# Standups

Standups are daily 15 mins meetings with your team.

Here is how it goes:

1. Step 1: Standup. Literally. The entire team stands up. This gives a sense of urgency and focus.
2. Step 2: Sync up. What you've worked on yesterday, what you're planning to work on today and do you have any blockers. Cover these subjects. Keep it short, no nitty-gritty.
3. Step 3: Questions and block time for further discussion.
4. Start your day.
