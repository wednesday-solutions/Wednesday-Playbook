# Aknowledgment of receipt of Playbook

I acknowledge I have read a copy of the Wednesday Solutions Playbook at [playbook.wednesday.is](https://playbook.wednesday.is), and I have understood its provisions. I further understand that if I have a question, I am obligated to ask the CEO for clarification of any provisions in the Employee Handbook.

I further understand that the statements contained in the playbook do not create any contractual or other legal obligations of employment. I also understand that WS may at any time modify, rescind, or revise any policy, benefit, or practice described in the playbook.

I acknowledge that it is my responsibility to read and become familiar with the contents of the playbook.
