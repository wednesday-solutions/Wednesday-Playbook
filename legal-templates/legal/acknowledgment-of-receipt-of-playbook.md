# Acknowledgment of receipt of Playbook

\#

I acknowledge I have read a copy of the Wednesday Playbook at playbook.wednesday.is, and understand its provisions. I further understand that if I have a question, I am obligated to ask the CEO for clarification of any provisions.

I further understand that the statements contained in the playbook do not create any contractual or other legal obligations of employment. I also understand that Wednesday may at any time modify, rescind, or revise any policy, benefit, or practice described in the playbook.

I acknowledge that it is my responsibility to read and become familiar with the contents of the playbook.
