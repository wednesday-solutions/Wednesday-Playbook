# Articles

Articles are detailed, longer, and show thought leadership. Each article should be between 3500 to 4000 words in length.

### The process

1. [Choose your topic](choose-your-topic.md)
2. [Write an outline](write-your-outline/)
3. [Sample project](sample-project/)
4. [First draft](first-draft/)
5. [Polish your draft](polish-your-draft/)

### The Board

We maintain a board with swimlanes and a calendar on Notion. Access to this workspace will be given to all writers.
