# Follow the four commandments

1. **Keep it simple:** It’s easy to get carried away with your sample project. Aim to keep it as simple as you can, while still accomplishing the goals you set out in your outline.
2. **Be practical:** The best sample projects show how to “re-implement a cool behavior found in app X”, or “provide a solution to this common question/problem” because you know that is a useful thing that people want to know how to do. Don’t be abstract; be practical.
3. **Remember how it fits in:** As you work on the sample project, always consider how it will fit into a teaching format. Think about the order in which you’ll implement features of the project, what parts will be challenges, etc.

   Remember to keep your project focused on a single learning objective. Don’t let the project distract the student with unnecessary work unrelated to the main topic.

4. **Use the latest and greatest:** You should always use the latest versions of any tools, libraries, OSs, etc. This will give your sample project the longest possible shelf life.
