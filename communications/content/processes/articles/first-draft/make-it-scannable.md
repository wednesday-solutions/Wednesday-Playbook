# Make it scannable

When busy developers read technical content, they often quickly **scan** through to find what they’re interested in. Here are some things you can do to help with that.

* **Don’t be wordy**: Remove excess words and say things concisely. To do this, here are [tons of great tips](https://procomm.ieee.org/communication-resources-for-engineers/style/write-clearly-and-concisely/).
* **Keep paragraphs short**: Keep paragraphs nice and short \(1-3 sentences max\) for easy reading/scannability.
* **Break into short sections**: Break your article into sections with section headings, too. Don’t let sections get too long. Readers appreciate opportunities to take a rest!
* **Descriptive section headings**: Headings should be short and descriptive, covering what’s inside the section \(such as “Drawing Arcs”\), rather than something “funny” \(like “Launching the Arc-Capacitor”\). This makes it easier to scan.
* **Use lists**: Whenever you’re describing a list of terms and definitions, rather than using paragraphs, put the content in an ordered or bulleted list. Use the format \[bolded term\]: definition - just like you see in this list!
