# Create your article outline

Now that you have a well-defined scope for your article, you are ready to write the actual outline. This means you need to think a bit about how your article will be structured.

For each section in your outline, you should note in brackets whether it is an instruction section, a theory section, or a reference section.

### List Section Types

Your outline should always include all three types of sections. If your outline only has instruction sections, youâ€™re doing it wrong!
