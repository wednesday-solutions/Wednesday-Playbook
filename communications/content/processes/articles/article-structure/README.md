# Article Structure

Each section in an article has one or more **section types**.

1. **Introduction**: Hook the reader, introduce the topic briefly, and tell the reader what they’ll build and what they’ll learn.
2. **Instruction Sections**: Provide the step-by-step instructions for adding code or building the app, and \(where possible\) end with a “build & run” step and screenshot.
3. **Getting Started Section**: The first instruction section in an article is a special case and should cover the initial steps to get started with the rest of the article.
4. **Theory Sections**: Explain high-level theory that you need to understand before you dive into the code, usually without step-by-step instructions.
5. **Reference Sections**: Lists what options are available for an API / technology for future reference; even those outside of the scope of the tutorial itself.
6. **Where to Go From Here?**: Summarizes what the reader has learned, and where they could go for more information or to further expand their skills.

These sections can be composed in **any order** \(except for the Introduction and Where to Go From Here sections which are always first and last\).

It’s even possible to **combine sections**: for example, to have a section that is primarily instruction with some reference or theory.
