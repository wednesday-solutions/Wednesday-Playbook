# Instruction Sections

Instruction sections provide the step-by-step instructions for adding code or building the app, and (where possible) end with a “build & run” step and screenshot.

This is the most common type of section you’ll have in an article.

1. **Include every step**: for example if you create a new file say select file → new
2. **Build and run**: Always include a screenshot after a build and run step. This way the reader has a way to co-relate to what you're seeing while building the prototype.
