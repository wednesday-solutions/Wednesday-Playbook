# Getting Started Section

The first instruction section in an article is a special case.

It should always be named **Getting Started** and should cover the initial steps to get started with the rest of the article.

If you have a starter project, typically this section should contain the following:

1. **Instructions to download the starter project**: Typically you can use a set sentence for this: “Download the starter project by clicking on the **Download Materials** button at the top or bottom of the tutorial.”
2. **An overview of the starter project**: This should include an overview of what the project does, a build and run with screenshots, and optionally an overview of the code.
3. **An overview of the problem**: Finally, give a description of what feature(s) you are trying to add to the starter project in this tutorial.
