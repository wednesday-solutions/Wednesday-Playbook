# Introduction Section

The introduction should be short, and should answer the following 5 questions:

1. What is your **topic**?
2. Why is it **important** to learn?
3. What will the reader **build** in this article?
4. What will the reader **learn** in this article?
5. What are the **prerequisites**? (if any)

While doing so, remember to **hook the reader** and get them excited.
