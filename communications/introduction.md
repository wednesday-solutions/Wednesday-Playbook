# Introduction

Welcome to the Wednesday communications handbook. Please use this book as a guide while writing for Wednesday.&#x20;

This book contains brand assets, content, and details on the language & tone to use. It serves as a checklist and ensures that our content is consistent across all channels and posts.

This book has two parts:

1. [Content](content/)
2. [Growth](broken-reference)

Good content is a differentiator. However, it's also important to get enough eyeballs on that content.&#x20;

### Our Goal

All content we publish should aim to:

* **Educate:** Educate readers about how we work, what we do, and how we do it.
* **Attract:** Future colleagues and customers.
