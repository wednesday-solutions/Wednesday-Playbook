# Daily Standups

A standup is a daily meeting typically held at the start of the day. Similar to sports where the team huddles up before each play, in software development, this helps the team stay informed and calibrated.

**Duration**: 15-20 mins

### The Structure

The meeting structure may be different for each team. However, the best we've identified is:

* What did I work on yesterday?
* What will I work on today?
* What issues are blocking me?

Each person gives updates using this structure. These meetings don't just need to be "updates", a light joke here or there lightens up the mood.
