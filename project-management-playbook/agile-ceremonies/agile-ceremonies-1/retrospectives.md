# Retrospectives

A retrospective is held at the end of the sprint. This meeting is held to understand the past and list down areas to improve on.

It's not mandatory to run this meeting every sprint but you should do it in the initial months of a project.

**Duration**: 1 hour \(max\)

### The Structure

* What went well - Ask the team to write down what went well.
* What didn't go well - Ask the team to write down what didn't go well.
* Action plan to improve - Prioritise the areas to improve on and create an action plan. Be disciplined and work on the actions.

### Miscellaneous

* **Followup**: Always address the concerns raised. Keep the team updated on the actions that have been taken from the last retrospective.
* **No finger-pointing**: We're all part of the same team. Pointing fingers and passing the blame is not encouraged.
* **Involve the entire team**: A retrospective should have all members of the sprint. Do not leave anyone out.
* **Talk about the good things**: For every two things that you'd like improved mention one good thing that happened.
