# Documentation

Document everything - decisions, milestones, feature requests, change requests, etc.

### Product Backlog

Write user stories. Think about the feature from the user's perspective, draw out the actions to be performed and write it down. Involve the customer in making decisions related to the actions, workflow, copy, and wireframes.

### Change Requests

If you're working on a turn-key project keep a track of all change requests. Each change request needs to be raised in writing and should be documented.

### Meetings

After each meeting with the customer write down the minutes and track the decisions taken. 

### Release Notes

Prepare release notes for each build and share these with the customer.
