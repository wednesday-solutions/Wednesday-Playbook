# Customer Onboarding Checklist

* **Process**: Explain our software development and design process. Entrepreneurs may or may not have a background in product development. Use presentations and emphasize the "how" rather than the "why".
* **Account setup**: Invite the customer to Slack, JIRA, Github, Zeplin, or any other SAAS tool used for the project \(limited to two invites per tool\).
* **Priorities**: Talk to the customer and understand their priorities.
* **Sprint Goals**: Explain the sprint goal at the start of each sprint. Make adjustments if required.

The key to stakeholder management is to ensure you set expectations correctly. When questions are raised address them immediately.
