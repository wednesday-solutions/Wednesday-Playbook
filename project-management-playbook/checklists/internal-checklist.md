# Internal Checklist

* **Team setup**: Setup a meeting with the tech lead. Ensure s/he understands the customer's business, deliverables, and milestones.
* **Slack**: Create an internal and external slack channel. Send invites to all team members to both channels. Invite the customer to the external channel.
* **JIRA**: Setup permissions, groups, workflows, and [swimlanes](../../engineering-playbook/project-management/jira/workflow.md). Invite customer\(s\) and project members to the project \(always set up a classic JIRA project\).
* **Github**: Create new repo\(s\) on Github and a team group. Grant access to all members of the team.
* **Zeplin**: Provision a new Zeplin project.
* **CI & CD**: We have template projects for all the frameworks we have expertise in. Ask the tech lead to use these as templates and set up Github actions for CI & CD.
* **Meetings**: Setup standups, sprint planning sessions, demos, and retrospective meetings.
* **Product Backlog**: Write user stories and build a product backlog. 
* **Estimation Criteria**: Setup time with the team and explain the ticket estimation criteria and the point system. 
* **Wikis**: Maintain a wiki either on Notion or on Confluence.
