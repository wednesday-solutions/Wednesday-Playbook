# Introduction

This handbook is meant for customers and project managers. It explains our approach to project management.

In a nutshell, project management involves two activities:

* **Stakeholder management**: Our motto is to "Teach and Tailor". Understand what the customer wants. Educate them about software development practices and tailor a solution that helps their business.
* **Delivery management**: Run agile sprints, build a product backlog, track sprint velocity, write user stories, and manage the team.
