# Introduction

The role of a project manager is different in different companies. This book outlines how we practice project management. It doesn’t go into the details of project management as a practice (there are enough books on that). Rather it focuses on our differentiators. The areas where we think a project manager should focus on to improve customer experience.

This book is meant for both customers and people interested in working with us. If you’re the latter it will help you understand what we expect & if you’re a customer it will help you understand what to expect.

In a nutshell, project management involves two activities:

* **Stakeholder Management**: Our motto is to "Teach and Tailor". Understand what the customer wants. Educate them about software development practices and tailor a solution that helps their business.
* **Product Management**: Understand business goals, study different actors in the system, and work with the customer to build product workflows.
* **Delivery Management**: Write user stories, build a backlog, run agile sprints, track sprint velocity, and manage the team.&#x20;
