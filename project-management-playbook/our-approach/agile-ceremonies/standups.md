# Standups

Depending on what works for your team please choose the right frequency. Some projects conduct these thrice a week whereas on others it might make sense to do these daily.

Standups shouldnâ€™t be more than 30 minutes long and should typically be done at the start of the day.

### Tips

* _Keep it short and to the point:_ Not more than 30 mins.
* _Turn-based:_ Our teams are distributed. Conduct the standup over zoom or hangout. Share your screen and filter tickets by each person. Each person then gives their update while everyone views the board.
* _Identify Blockers:_ Note blockers down and get them resolved asap.
