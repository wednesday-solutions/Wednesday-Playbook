# Team Management

You cannot deliver a great digital product without the support of your team. Here are some pointers to ensure they've got your back:

* **Keep them updated**: Make sure your team understands the goals, and user stories well.
* **Rework**: Sometimes it does take more than 1 iteration to get a feature right. Explain to your team why they're building it again and how the change will help the user.
* **Retrospectives**: Act on the concerns raised during the retrospectives.
* **1:1s**: Schedule monthly one on ones. These aren't related to appraisals rather a meeting for you to collect feedback on how you are doing.
