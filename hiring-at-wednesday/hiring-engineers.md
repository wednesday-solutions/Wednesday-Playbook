## **Miscellaneous**

* After each step in the interview process, we will let you know the outcome within 2-3 working days.

Given this what we look for the most are examples of what you have built on your own. Have you learned a new programming language? Have you built/contributed to an open-source project? If you've been doing it so far you'll continue to do it ahead.
